# Blueberry Winery Data Analysis and Machine Learning Project

## Description
This project involves analyzing datasets from Blueberry Winery, a Portuguese wine producer. Through data wrangling, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning (ML) techniques, valuable insights were extracted from the data.

## Features
* fixed acidity
* volatile acidity
* citric acid
* residual sugar
* chlorides
* free sulfur dioxide
* total sulfur dioxide
* density
* pH
* sulphates
* alcohol
* quality

## Key Highlights
* Conducted comprehensive data wrangling and cleaning to ensure data quality.
* Performed EDA to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset.
* Applied various machine learning algorithms to develop predictive models and gain deeper insights.
* Evaluated model performance using precision, recall, and F1 score.
* Extracted valuable insights into wine quality, chemical correlations, and other factors influencing Blueberry Winery's business decisions.
* Addressed class imbalance in the dataset: high-quality wines were underrepresented compared to medium-quality wines.
* Found Random Forest to be the most reliable model due to its ability to handle large data, complex patterns, and robustness to outliers, despite its high memory requirements.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
